**Python - Object-relational mapping**
For this project, I have gained insights on how object-relational mapping is used for database scripting. I have attained more knowledge through the use of MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to query, create, edit, and delete data or tables in MySQL.

***TESTS***
    tests: This is the folder that bears SQL and Python scripts for setting up test tables for all files provided by ALX.
